                <p>&nbsp;This is a Galaga Inspired Game called Agalag that was developed by the team called Kismet Collective. I am the Project Lead of this Project.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;This game uses FLECCS and DirectX11 as its foundations. We had to create a system to take models made in blender and render them with DirectX11 using FlECCS Update calls. </p>
